# Survival Analysis
In this project, we applied survival analysis concepts to the unemployment dataset January Current Population Surveyâ€™s Displaced Workers Supplements (DWS) for 1986, 1988, 1990, and 1992. We used AIC/BIC metric to identify for a condensed, stratified models that selects from the pool of covariates and their interaction terms. Diagnostic checks with log-log plots and GOF tests were conducted to assert the Cox Proportional Hazard model assumptions. We generated Kaplan-Meier curves, produced regression coefficients, L-R tests, and confidence intervals to study the difference in unemployment rates across various racial groups.
